GetMyHouseValue UK

This is a free tool for estimating UK residential property values based on historical sold data.

How it Works

Users provide a UK postcode.

The tool retrieves historical "Price Paid" data from the HM Land Registry.

It adjusts the last sold price using the Office for National Statistics (ONS) House Price Index (HPI) for that specific region (e.g., London, South East).

It returns an estimated current market value range.
